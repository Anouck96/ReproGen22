## Calculating outliers

The notebooks in this repository explore the reliability of our participants' scores.
Run them using `jupyter notebook`.

### Requirements
The code in this repository uses the following modules. Given the general nature
of the code, most versions probably work.

* `numpy` 
* `scipy`
* `pandas`
* `seaborn`
* `matplotlib`

### Table of contents
* `README.md` - this file.
* `Correlations between respondents (BME).ipynb` - Compute reliability for the BME metric.
* `Correlations between respondents (Likert).ipynb` - Compute reliability for the Likert metric.
* `Correlations between respondents (RME).ipynb` - Compute reliability for the RME metric.
* `Correlations between respondents (RR).ipynb` - Compute reliability for the RR metric.
* `Figures` - Plots generated by the notebooks. The cropped version is generated using the `pdfcrop` utility, which comes with TeXLive.
* `Responses` - The raw response data.
