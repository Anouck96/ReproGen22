Thanks again for participating! This study looked at the quality of texts that were automatically generated by a neural network. Neural networks need to be \u201ctrained\u201d (i.e., learn from examples) in order to be able to produce texts and the training examples that we give them can have a big impact on the texts that these text-generating systems produce. In the experiment you participated in, you saw text generated by three systems and a reference utterance. You were asked to rate these responses. With this, we wanted to investigate if the manner of rating had any influence on the ratings. For example, we compared rating with a Likert scale to best-worst scaling (ranking results from best to worst).<br>\n<br>\nDo you have any questions or comments?
